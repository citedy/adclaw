## The OpenClaw Ecosystem

OpenClaw (247K stars) created the "personal AI agent" paradigm. Several projects extend or compete with it:

| Project | Stars | What it does | AdClaw advantage |
|---|---|---|---|
| **OpenClaw** | 247K | Personal agent, 13,700+ community skills | Security: our 208-pattern scanner vs their 820+ malicious skills crisis |
| **nanobot** | 33.6K | Ultra-lightweight OpenClaw in 4,000 lines | We have a full Web UI, multi-persona, marketing tools |
| **NanoClaw** | 21K | Containerized agent on Claude SDK | We support 22 LLM providers, not just Claude |
| **Hermes Agent** | 7.4K | Self-learning agent with 3-layer memory | We have marketing-specific skills (130+) and AgentHub |
| **ClawWork** | 6.7K | AI agents that earn real money | Our AgentHub karma economy is a lighter version of this |
| **OpenClaw MC** | 2.4K | Governance dashboard for agent fleets | We have built-in dashboard, not a separate tool |
| **ClawBands** | — | Security middleware (human-in-the-loop) | Our security is built-in, not middleware |
| **clawsec** | — | Security skills for OpenClaw | Our scanner runs automatically on every skill |

## What AdClaw Adds Over CoPaw

AdClaw started as a CoPaw fork but was reworked extensively (~80% rewritten):

- **+68 skills** (130+ total) — SEO, ads, content, social media, growth hacking, analytics
- **Multi-agent personas** — each with own identity (SOUL.md), LLM, skills, MCP tools, and cron schedule
- **@tag routing** — `@researcher find AI trends` in Telegram or Web chat
- **Coordinator persona** — synthesis-driven orchestration: reads AOM for persona activity, LLM analyzes results, emits TaskStrategy with specific delegations, continue/pivot/abandon logic
- **Dashboard page** — persona status cards with model, skills, cron preview
- **Per-persona chat tabs** — isolated sessions with shared memory
- **Always-On Memory (AOM)** — vector search, FTS5, 4 typed memory categories (user/feedback/project/reference), smart consolidation with contradiction detection, 5-layer optimization (R1-R5), prompt caching
- **Memory sanitizer** — 33 threat patterns across 7 categories
- **Skill security scanner** — 208 patterns + analysis-first LLM audit with 8 category-specific criteria (SEO, browser, data...), critical short-circuit, block/warn/install flow, auto-heal
- **AgentHub integration** — distributed tasks with karma economy
- **here.now file publishing** — instant shareable links for any file
- **Citedy MCP server** — 52 marketing tools (SEO, trends, competitor analysis, lead magnets)
- **22 LLM providers, 100+ models** — OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, OpenRouter, DeepSeek, Groq, Cerebras, Together, Mistral, Baseten, MiniMax, Inception, Moonshot, xAI, Aliyun, DashScope, Ollama, llama.cpp, MLX, and more
- **LLM auto-fallback** — configurable chain with timeout; if primary model fails, auto-switch to backup
- **OpenRouter routing** — auto, nitro, free, floor modes for optimal cost/speed
- **English-only UI** — removed all Chinese text from console and runtime
